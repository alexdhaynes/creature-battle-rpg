# Base Game - Phaser

- a 2D rpg game template for phaser

## Package manager

- yarn

## Commands

`yarn dev`

## TODOS

- move the game to phaser-react template when closer to done

## Ideas

What if we could structure Phaser like React? So:
`<Scene>
    <Container>
        <TextLabel name="HP">
        <TextLabel name="Level">
    </Container>
</Scene>`
What would it take to build something like this?
